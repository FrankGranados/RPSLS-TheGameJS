### Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, the online game in JavaScript
RPSLS is a game originally invented by blogger Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, as a variant of the original rock-paper-scissors game, which became popular after its mention on the tv show "The big bang theory" in the episode. 17 of the 5th season.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Getting Started
The rules: "**Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors**."
